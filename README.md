# CART
This is the code of a conversation-based adaptive relational translation framework (CART) for next POI recommendation with uncertain check-ins. The CART consists of two modules: 
1. the recommender built upon the adaptive relational translation method performs location prediction; 
2. the conversation manager aims to achieve successful recommendations with the fewest conversation turns. 

## Pre-requisits
