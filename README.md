# CART
This is the code of a conversation-based adaptive relational translation framework (CART) for next POI recommendation with uncertain check-ins. The CART consists of two modules: 
1. The recommender built upon the adaptive relational translation method performs location prediction; 
2. The conversation manager aims to achieve successful recommendations with the fewest conversation turns. 

## Pre-requisits
* ### Running environment
  - Python 3.7.4
  - Pytorch 1.4.0
  - pandas 0.25.1
  
* ### Datasets
Three datasets which are generated from Foursquare in three cities, i.e., Calgary (CAL), Charlotte (CHA) and Phoenix (PHO).
```bash
https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/
```
```

```


* ### Modules of CART
  - #### Recommender
      generate_data.py (input generation)
      
      train.py (train translation model)
      
  - #### Conversation Manager
      pn.py (action generator)
      
      agent.py (state tracker, online update)
      
      env.py (user response)
      
## How to run
You can run Train_TransE.py directly. Change Parsers in need.
